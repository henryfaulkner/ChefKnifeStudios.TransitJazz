# Specification Quality Checklist: Historical Transit Statistics

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-09-20  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation completed on 2026-09-20. The existing worker-dashboard definition supplies the v1 source catalogue; the concrete data schema, import execution mechanism, source-query access proof, and retention policy are intentionally deferred to planning.
- A direct Grafana integration is not registered in this runtime, so the specification is based on the versioned dashboard definition in the repository. Planning must verify live source access and the actual remaining retention window before the time-sensitive import begins.
